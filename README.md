# Vector Tools

A tiny project to recycle easy vector operations. See ```core.py``` to explore the available functions. Someone are:

* **distance**
* **midpoint**
* **angle**
* **triangle_area** (based on Heron formula)
* **triangle_compactness** 
* **...**

Usually, the input ```vertices``` should have dimension (2, 3) or (3, 3) as appropriate.
